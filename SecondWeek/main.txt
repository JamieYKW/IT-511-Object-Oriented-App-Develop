There were two assignments this week:

Input and Output
"Write a short Java application that uses the Scanner class to accept the first name and last name from the user. 
Your application will use the print() or println() method to display a message that greets the user. 
Example: “Hello Jane Coder!” Take a screenshot to verify that your message is displayed successfully. 
Cut and paste the screenshot into a Word document and attach this document to your submission."
