This week's homework was a part of our bigger final project.

Message Array:
"Write an application that uses an Array to store 10 messages of type String. 
You can load this data structure with 10 messages of your choosing. 
For example a message could be “I love Java the programming language!” or another message could be 
“I love Java the drink!” You can initialize your Array with the messages or have the user enter the messages. The choice is yours. 
Once your Array is loaded with 10 messages, use a loop to iterate through your entire list and display each message."
