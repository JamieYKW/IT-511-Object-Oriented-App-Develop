There were two assignments this week:

Loops:
"You will write a short Java application that uses a loop control structure. 
Use the Scanner class to accept a number between 1 and 10 from the user. 
While the number entered is not between 1 and 10 (inclusive), an error message will be displayed 
“The number entered was not between 1 and 10!” and the program will loop back to prompt the user for another number. 
If the number entered is between 1 and 10 (inclusive), the application will display a message 
“Good job! The number you entered is ” and the program will end.
Do not use a break statement in your program."

Using Strings:
"You will write a short Java application that will accept five strings from the user. 
Each String will be a word in a sentence. 
The first word will be a subject, the second word will be a verb, the third word will be an adjective, 
the fourth word will be an object, and the fifth word will be an adverb. 
After all five words are entered, display the sentence using the following form: Subject - Verb - Adjective - Object - Adverb."
